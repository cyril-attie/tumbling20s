    <h2>Hello, Crisis!</h2>
    <span>
      <p>
        The crystal clear criteria of a Crisis happening is that prices of <i data-toggle="tooltip"
          title="A tangible asset is a real estate or production good. An intangible asset is a share of the property or the debt often linked to a set of tangible assets like a company.">assets</i>
        fall sharply, behind 50% of their peak price in less than 3 years.
      </p>
      <p>
        A crisis, it has been asserted, is a bad or wrong time for the economy. Not for those who know what a crisis
        really
        is. To test whether a crisis is bad, we would need to define an economic purpose. So that any action nearing us
        to our purpose is defined as good, and the rest is bad. 
      </p>
      <p>
          Let's observe for who a crisis is good and for who it is bad. The ones that have savings invested in some asset become frightened of having lost 50% of their
        savings.
        And that happens to all those who were not informed and did not know to foresee the coming crisis. For most of
        the people it becomes a
        bad time.
        Clients, having lost wealth, consume less so businesses struggle to earn <i data-toggle="tooltip"
          title="Revenue is the income of companies.">revenue</i>.
        Shopping sales slow down, store inventories pile up. Eventually companies lower prices in search for revenue.
        But wages often cannot be lowered (at least
        below the minimum legal threshold). Consequently companies fire employees because they fail at earning
        enough
        money to pay <i data-toggle="tooltip"
          title="Liabilities are all the debts or pending payments, as for example wages, that a company owes.">liabilities</i>.
        The blossoming unemployed people difficults even more the rush for revenue, and falling revenues sweep a
        great portion of <i data-toggle="tooltip"
          title="Profit is the income of owners of companies. It is the result of subtracting costs to revenues.">profits</i>.
        In the stock market, a fair price for a company is 10 times the profits of the company.
        With a disappearing profits stock prices fall even more, below 50% their peak price.
      </p>
      <p>
        But there's a right side to everything. People that can dispose of money during the crisis find cheap prices.
        This group can
        be divided in two major categories: </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Those that have savings</li>
        <li>Those that can take a credit</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The cheaper the price of an investment the lower the risk. To catch the crisis cheap price one needs money.
        Having money means being prepared. Being prepared one gets to invest at a lower risk.
        On the other side of the market panic is taking over. People that invested at a high price take losses. Taking
        losses makes
        one become wary and mistrustful. Frustration and anxiety to see prices come back to their peak spreads. People
        that becomes unemployed also thinks negatively. Crisis induced negativity is an economic depression. An economic
        depression happens after prices have fallen. Entrepreneurs are negative about starting a new business. And I
        want to change this reaction. If you do not have an economic background this website is made for you. Here you
        will get a glance on <a href="economics.html">why and how crises happen. </a> As well we will look into <a
          href="forecasting.html">how the Tumbling 20’s Crisis</a>, a 2020's great depression trigger, is happening.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you do not have an economic background I recommend reading Tumblien’s tale before continuing. If you are
        familiar with the meaning of economic concepts such as capital, money, banks. If you can distinguish monetary
        and price inflation. In short,if you are an economic and financial markets geek. Then proceed reading on this
        page to understand the implications of crises. I've made it worth your time.

        During periods of <i data-toggle="tooltip"
          title=" Inflation happens when the quantity of money is increasing, generally due to credit granting.">inflation</i>,
        the quantity of circulating money inflates due to credit. Mainly businessmen and speculators take credit.
        Businessmen buy capital products. Speculators buy assets to re-sell them at a higher price. As the greater
        quantity of money is felt, its value falls. It becomes easier
        to find somebody willing to give you money for any work because there is more money in total. So happens
        <strong>price inflation: product prices go up</strong>. But inflation isn’t felt simultaneously by all people.
        As credit is granted to buy capital products, the firsts to feel
        inflation are the traders of capital products. Their revenue abnormally increases: new clients, that wouldn’t
        buy without the existence of credit, come to buy capital products.
      </p>
      <p>As <i data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mainly industrial and technological sector.">capital companies</i> increase
        their revenue, they employ more people and raise the salary of already existing employees. Employees spend their
        money in a variety of products. So once new money filters down to employees,all products sales increase and
        eventually product prices inflate. Consequently most companies see their revenues and
        profits increase. To expand production, companies employ more people. Unemployment falls. Wages grow as people
        find new job openings. Money abounds in the hands of all. But prices increase, so the same quantity of money is
        able to purchase less goods.
      </p>
      <p> To avoid a too noticeable decrease in the value of money banks rise interest rates. Recall, profits equal
        revenues minus costs. Rising
        interest rates increases financial costs, so directly shrinks business profits. As projects become less
        profitable, entrepreneurs
        and speculators abandon their projects. They fire people, <i data-toggle="tooltip"
          title="Liquidate means sell immediately for cash.">liquidate</i> capital and give back their credit to the
        bank. Money flows back to the banks and piles up there. The circulating money deflates, gets scarcer. It becomes
        more difficult to find buyers, people willing to pay for products or assets, at the current high prices. So all
        prices, wages, products and assets, tend to revert their trend and to start falling. The monetary deflation
        causes price deflation.
      </p>
      <p>Price deflation spirals into a crisis. Asset prices fall behind 50% of their peak price in less than 3
        years.<strong> Prices crashing</strong> represents an opportunity. Entrepreneurs and speculators desperate
        trying to sell their assets to give back their debt. So they sell assets cheaper than elsewhen because of the
        urgency. So prices stay at this depressed low level until massive new credit is granted. In times of deflation,
        not any entrepreneur dares to take a credit. The bad times are too recent and the prospect of business are
        unexciting. Basically if nobody takes a credit again all the money disappears. If money disapears the trading
        would collapse and restart on another monetary basis.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the government, not like businessmen, does not worry about giving back its credit. Men in the government
        have incentives to spend: gaining popularity among receivers and among bankers. Bankers finance the government
        spending as well as the politician campaign. And all the banking system depends on government reflating money by
        taking a big credit. Money reflation is commonly called monetary stimulus. The government is the only entity
        that can relaunch the economy. Relaunch commerce by taking a big credit and pouring this new money
        into the circulation. As soon as the government and the medias speak about spending, "stimulate or rescue the
        economy”, the mood reverts. The entrepreneur public starts believing the prices will eventually turn up again.
        Then entrepreneurs take credit to acquire capital at the cheap price. And the cycle loops.
      </p>
      <p>
        Crisis is the opportunity for governments to make the expensive projects. Expensive government projects are
        infrastructure: like roads, hospitals, public transport, schools and administration, or wars. In every country a
        fake dialectical opposition collaborates towards expanding debt: left vs right, red vs blue, progressist vs
        "conservatives", communist vs "capitalists" (quotes indicate these labels are misused). This opposition is
        always willing to spend in order to gain popularity albeit among groups. The left-communist prefers to spend on
        social measures, favoring the low-income people and minorities. The right-"capitalists" prefer to spend on
        armament and wars, favoring military armament, industrial and technological companies. From the economic point
        of vue both are suboptimal. Economically, the optimal government abstains demanding effort to satisfy unpersonal
        needs, but rather orchestrates individual initiatives so they blend. (bazaar and cathedral link)
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a detail, that is rarely understood, that I deem the most important fact of the monetary cycle loop.
        In order to be able to give back the debt, entrepreneurs and the government need rising prices. In a falling
        prices environment it is increasingly difficult to raise money. So it is to give back the debt. That is why, on
        signs of deflation (typically rising interest rates), entrepreneurs give back their debt. To keep the prices
        steadily increasing, subsequent credits must be bigger than previous ones. In other words, the quantity of bank
        money is always increasing, which is against the very nature of money. Let me illustrate this with an example.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let’s imagine a society in which there are 100 ounces of gold existing. In this society gold is used as money.
        Every year 1 ounce is mined, and 1 ounce gets lost in the sea or nature. So the quantity of gold is constant.
        Some gold is circulating and some
        is stored. Imagine that on the first day of year 1 everybody puts his real money, the gold, in the bank in
        exchange for a bill. So
        at the beginning of the first year there are 100 bills existing and circulating. And the bank stores 100 ounces
        of gold that back the bills.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the first 5 years, the bank issues 4 additional bills every year to grant credit to entrepreneurs and
        speculators. They grant credit at 2.5% interest rate per year, a fairly low interest rate. Interest cost is a
        percentage of the previous end-of-year debt balance. After 5 years the quantity of bills circulating inflates to
        120 (initial 100 plus 4 per year during 5 years). The debt balance at the end of the fifth year is 21.55 bills
        (20 issued as credit plus 1.55 of accumulated interest
        costs of the 5 years). At this stage prices have been rising: the monetary inflation has caused price inflation.
      </p>
      <p>
        To dissimulate monetary and price inflation banks rise the interest rates to 6%. They keep the interest rates at
        this high level for 5 years. This causes monetary deflation: entrepreneurs return bills to the bank instead of
        taking newly issued bills. The circulating bills decrease
        instead of increasing. In other words, every year 4 bills are subtracted from the circulating bills and put into
        the bank.
      </p>
      <p>
        After 5 years returning money to the banks, the quantity of money has fallen back to 100 bills. But now prices
        are lower than at the beginning, do you guess why? Credits taken by entrepreneur in the first 5 years were
        used to buy capital products. These productive investments are giving results. Capital products have the
        ability to increase productivity, which is the quantity of products we produce per day (or any other unit of
        time). Capital assets acquired during the first 5 years are yielding greater availability of products. Greater
        availability of products result in lower prices. But remember, for governments and entrepreneurs to pay off
        debts we need steadily increasing prices.
      </p>
      <p>
        To compensate for the lower prices, money to be poured into circulation through credit must be greater than the
        previous credit. Bankers increase the yearly credit granted by 4 every inflation period. So from year 11 to year
        16, the quantity of bills issued through credit per year is 8 bills. Also, the yearly credit returned to the
        banks increases by 2 every deflation period. Therefore from year 16 to year 21 the yearly quantity of bills
        returned is 6. And so on. The following table illustrates the evolution of the monetary and financial state, the
        money and debt quantities, every year for the first 50 years and every 25 years for the next 250 years.

        The table shows how after 40 years running such a banking system it is impossible to pay off the debt:
        the bills existing in total are 210, of which 160 are circulating and 50 are in the bank. But the total debt
        owed to the bank has become 181
        bills. Circulating 160, owed 181. Basically there is not anymore enough bills circulating to pay off the debt
        owed to the bank.
        Consequently this debt can never be paid after 40 years, peoples using this money are trapped. Any
        inflation of the circulating bills implies an equal and growing the debt increase. Due to interest rates the
        debt
        exponentially increases through time. Therefore the only an exponential productivity can cope with an
        exponential debt. But productivity is not exponential, and <a href="beopen.org" target="_blank">shouldn't
          be</a>. The only chance for people to pay the debt would be to devalue completely the bills. But it is absurd
        to devalue money, money was created to store value. To store the value of work between production and
        consumtion. The value of wealth, which originally was accumulated work.</p>
      <p>
        The example is meant to demonstrate the absurdity of the monetary and financial system; unless the purpose of
        governments is to service bankers rather than peoples.
      </p>
      <p>
        Three economic conclusions can be done from the banking system knowledge. First, things are cheaper in the
        present than in the
        future. If you have a project, now is the time. This can be proved by asking any elder on the street, "What was
        the price of houses when You were young?" the answer will likely be about a seventh what they are today. Second,
        for the purpose of being at ease economically, it is good to get debt and spend it in productive
        assets to boost your individual productivity. By economically at ease I mean satisfied and free to purchase
        convenient products and services. Third, just avoid debt on bad conditions: high interest rates make the debt
        balance skyrocket fast. At
        least faster than the money you can raise with productive assets purchased. Debts with no interest or low
        interest (less
        than 2.5%) are good debts. These will let your projects to live financially in peace, however they must still be
        useful for society and profitable. Actually that is what corporations do, as soon as the estimated profit is
        higher than the debt costs, they
        undertake the project. And eventually they'll close if it proves unprofitable.
      </p>
      <p>
        To sum up previous ideas. Rising interests make entrepreneurs deflate money by paying off debt. Deflation
        spirals and only government, an impersonal organization allowed to stea... to tax everybody, incurs massive debt
        and spending to save the banking system. To save the banking system that financed political campaigns and to be
        voted by the people who benefits from the speding. From crisis to crisis, credits are ever increasing, money
        ever inflating.
        Thanks to the massive debt and taxes, governments provide services at a price below cost. With such a competitor
        it is harder for entrepreneurs to prosper. Second the common debt is unpayable unless we tax people more
        severely. But nobody wants to be taxed! So the government incurs additional spending to investigate people
        revenues and demand people more money, if they can. In some places this turns into soft authoritarism. Soft
        authoritarianism is a government that enforces rules and taxes at the expense of personal freedom. Governments
        would contribute more to the personal well-being by letting the poisoned banking system fall and act towards
        optimizing defending the integration of individual efforts.
      </p>

      <p>
        To conclude, crisis are often thought of as an accident but many people benefit from it and some intentionally
        provoke it. In every crisis, there is a healthy vs a precipitated choice to be made. The precipitated choice is
        to react to the provoked crisis: relaunch the economy with a government credit. Insightfully massive government
        credit sustains the system. Credit mantains the artificially swollen capital products industry and the rising
        product prices. The fast development of Internet might have been favored by a strong financial system. Indeed
        credit has greatly been used to fund capital products, like computers. However the healthy choice is
        to halt the assymetric bill-money system, to return to an open and explicit monetary system. Either by
        using product money like gold and silver or by using blockchain crypto-currencies and tokens. Probably the
        solution will be a
        combination of both.
      </p>
      <p>
        Blockchains must still experiment scalability and mass adoption. They’re proving to be the
        most legitimate alternative to optimize integration of people's efforts. Blockchains, especially smart
        contracts, allow to integrate individuals accoridng to rules, resolve conflicts and remove the central
        authority. Central authority is corruptible. Politicians
        of the government have proven to be either economics ignorant or hipocritical conspirators. Whichever,
        Blockchain smart contracts bring a an incorruptible solution to this weak point of society and the economy.
