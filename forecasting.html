      A premise to forecast is to have <strong>indicators that warn ahead of time</strong> of what will happen. I will
      build this forecast on the model exposed <a href="crisis.html#crisis-explaination">here</a> that can be called the
      T20 model. I invite you to be patient. It hasn't been easy to create a model simple enough to be understood by
      everyone and, at the same time, helpful to understand economic happenings of our time.
    </p>
    <p>
      We concluded monetary deflation and production surplus causes price deflation. As price deflation is the cause of
      falling revenue and profits, I have searched my indicators that warned of monetary deflation and production
      surplus. Rising interest rates and debt being paid off are premonitory of monetary deflation. Below you can see
      both measures. Interest rates since 1954 and total debt securities of all sectors since 1946.

    <p>
      At eyesight, total debt balance increases exponentially. To check whether it is an exponential and to gain any
      insight, I rather take the change year-over-year of the total debt balance. For those who are not into
      mathematics: the variation of an exponential growth also follows an exponential growth, therefore the change
      year-over-year of total debt balance is expected to have the same shape. Actually it kind of have the same shape,
      though more volatile, until 2007.I unravel why debt increase doesn't look anymore exponential from 2007 <a
        href="forecasting.html#printing-money"></a> later on here</a>.

      The last two crises happened in spring 2000, named dot-com crisis, and in autumn 2008, named real estate crisis.
      At these times asset prices fell more than 50% in less than 3 years. Half of the wealth of people disapeared. Such
      a panic.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the curious: unless explicitly specified, "interest rates" refers to the Effective Federal Funds interest
      rate: the rate set by central bank for banks to borrow funds from each other overnight (for just one day). This
      rate leads all other interest rates.
    </p>
    <p>
      Important remark: you will notice that I always speak first about the US. The reason for that is that US dollars
      have been the world currency. Since 1945 massive inter-national transactions, like oil and debts, have been
      conducted in US dollars. Besides US was the biggest client and the biggest seller of the international market. So
      whatever happened in the monetary plan, inflation or deflation, in US was likely affecting all other countries; at
      least those who trade internationally.
    </p>
    <p>
      Focusing on the dot-com crisis in 2000. Between January 1999 and spring 2000 oil prices went from 10$/barrel to
      35$/barrel. Oil is used to transport products and make packaging materials, so an increase in the price of oil
      causes price inflation. Resulting in interest rates climbing from 4.6% to 6.5% in roughly the same period. From
      spring 2000 to summer 2002, in two years, the <i data-toggle="tooltip"
        title="The Nasdaq 100 is an sum of the price 100 most expensive companies of the stock market.">Nasdaq 100</i>,
      a sotck market index of tech companies fell from 5000 to 800. Near 85% of savings invested in these companies
      disapeared. Other indexes displayed also great losses:
      <ul>
        <li>S&P500 (United States) from 1560 to 760 ~51% loss</li>
        <li>Nikkei225 (Japan) from 21000 to 7500 ~65% loss</li>
        <li>SSE (China) from 2250 to 1000 ~55% loss</li>
        <li>HSI (Hong-Kong) 18300 to 8300 ~55% loss</li>
        <li>DAX30 (Germany) from 8400 to 2250 ~75% loss</li>
        <li>FTSE100 (United Kingdom) from 6950 to 3275 ~52% loss</li>
        <li>CAC40 (France) from 7000 to 2425 ~65% loss</li>
        <li>IBEX35 (Spain) from 13000 to 5250 ~60% loss</li>
      </ul>
      There are discrepancies between the indexes performance. However the common pattern is more than 50% loss in less
      than 3 years. The starting date was spring 2000. The trigger was a 2-year period of interest rates rising. And
      during the dot com crisis interest rates were lowered from 6.5% to 1%, that's a great stimulus. I could zoom
      deeper into the crisis. Bring out company profits statistics, unemployment and inflation figures to point out
      coincidences. However past is past and, luckily, better things to observe are happening in the present.
    </p>
    <p>

      From autumn 2001 to autumn 2004 interest rates remained under 2%. The obejective was to make the public take debt
      again. The government heavily sponsored people wanting to purchase a home and financed wars in Afghanistan and
      Iraq took place. Quantities of US dollars were poured into the economy and consumerism started again. The monetary
      economy was reflated and in the fall of 2004 oil traded above 40$/barrel, which is a sing of inflation. The
      central bank rose rates for two years again. From 1% to 5.25% in less than 2 years. House prices, that had been
      rising thanks to the previous cheap credit, topped. And so did rates that stayed at 5.25% for more than a year.
      That was the indicator of a new crisis coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the higher interest rate, people started defaulting on their mortgage. House prices fell due to demand drying
      out when supply was at its peak. Though the stock market and interest peaked in autumn 2007, prices didn't crash
      till summer 2008: the bankruptcy of great financial institutions in september 2008 panicked investors.

      In the 3 years following October 2008 the asset prices fell more than 50% because of monetary deflation:
      <ul>
        <li>HGX (US housing market) from 600 to 55 ~90% loss</li>
        <li>S&P500 (United States) from 1575 to 675 ~57% loss</li>
        <li>Nikkei225 (Japan) from 18400 to 7000 ~61% loss</li>
        <li>SSE (China) from 6100 to 1675 ~72% loss</li>
        <li>HSI (Hong-Kong) 32000 to 11000 ~65% loss</li>
        <li>DAX30 (Germany) from 8225 to 3600 ~54% loss</li>
        <li>FTSE100 (United Kingdom) from 6750 to 3500 ~52% loss</li>
        <li>CAC40 (France) from 6170 to 2500 ~60% loss</li>
        <li>IBEX35 (Spain) from 16000 to 6700 ~58% loss</li>
      </ul>
      Assets prices fell more than 50% in 3 years. In the attempt to reflate the monetary base, <strong>the central bank
        lowered
        interest rates from 5.25% in summer 2007 to 0.2% in Christmas 2008</strong>. Panic spread. The low interest
      rates alerted
      investors of a possible devaluation of bank money to worthless paper.That's why in the same period Gold broke its
      all time high of ~800$/oz. In the following 5 years gold skyrocketed to 1915$/oz.
    </p>
    <p>
      Business was critically depressed. None wanted to take debt and the government debt to save financial
      institutions was not enough. The head of the central bank said he would throw money from an helicopter if
      necessary. Rather the central bank decided to buy assets, mainly financial assets like government <i
        data-toggle="tooltip"
        title="Bonds are pieces, typically of 100$ or 1000$, of government or corporate debt">bonds and stocks. This way
        they would <strong>inject money bypassing the need to find a debt taker</strong>. Bankers have injected like
        this $3,500 billion which is approximately 25% of the $14,000 billion existing over 3 years. A huge amount.
    </p>
    <p>
      The below chart plots the central bank assets. Since 1945 until 2009 the central bank assets were stable, below
      900 million dollars. Since 2009 the central bank has acquired $3.5 trillion. Though originally the assets of the
      central bank were gold and silver and their liabilities were central banks bills the game has changed. Since 2009
      central banks store government and corporate bonds as good as gold. But these debts will be redeemed in the very
      same currency that their liability is. So basically when they print money to inject it, prices rise due to
      monetary inflation. When they retrieve money by selling the bonds in the market, prices will fall due to monetary
      deflation. That is a really assymetric game. Since 2009 they decide the turning points of the market as they are
      the biggest player in the market. They have infinite money, as they write the bank accounts. To buy something they
      just need to increase your bank account in some units and that's it.

    <p>
      Important note: the US central bank is privately owned by 12 regional banks privately, in turn owned by all
      banks beloging to the system. Ownership of the central bank is a must to contribute belong to the system. Stock of
      these central banks cannot be traded or pledged and, by law, earn 6% dividend on capital invested.
      This dividend shall be <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/section7.htm">cumulative</a>. Which
      means their share in the central bank can grow exponentially and then, the plan would be, to cash out future
      dividend when the equity share has grown. Compounding $1 at 6% for 100 years yields $339 for every dollars
      invested initially. Resulting in a dividend of ~$20 per $1 invested. That is for the US central bank that was the
      first modern central bank. In every country regulations regarding central bank profits distribution are different.
    </p>

    <!-- UP TILL HERE IT IS CHECKED AND SATISFACTORY -->
    <p>
      As you can check in <a href="forecasting.html#chart-interest-rates">the above chart</a>, interest rates have been
      steadily increasing recently. Since December 2015 interest rates have gone from ~0.1% to ~2.4%. Furthermore, on
      the
      above <a href="#total-fed-assets">chart</a>, you can see the US central bank assets topped in January 2015 at
      ~$4.5 trillion. Since then it has been draining out $640 billion from circulation, roughly the GDP of Argentina.
      These two measures are <strong>strongly deflationary</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Becuase Trump was elected in autumn 2016. Trumponomics have been very inflationary. So two opposite forces have
      been in action. First Trump spoke a lot about war with North Korea. Remember war is the way republicans, the
      right/"capitalists", spend money. But it was all fake and he'll probably wait a worst econoic time to actually
      start war and reflationary spending. Also Trump lowered corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%, among other policies.
      This
      resulted in corporations having unexpected additional cash. For profits calculation, the increased financial cost
      was considered
      insignificant compared to the shrinked fiscal cost. Summing cost variations resulted in additional income for
      stock holders. Accordingly the stock market kept rising to new maximums, from ~5000 in Dec 2016 to ~7500 in Oct
      2018 +50%).
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is a first bold statement (at least as of June 5th 2019): the stock market reached its highest high one month
      ago,
      for the next 3 years the price will fall below 50% of its current price. How do I know a Crisis is coming? Well
      among many other roles in life I have been a trader in the stock market. Trading the stock market lets you observe
      greed and fear are the unconscious forces driving market prices. Fear is shown when the prices are underestimated.
      Typically towards the end of a crisis when prices crash most traders are packining. Greed is shown when stock
      market prices are too high. High prices indicate future overexpectation. And that is what's happening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let me highlight 2 indicators of greedy overconfidence. First prices today are twice the standard. Historically, a
      company investment has always yielded ~10% while a debt investment ~5%. In other words, according to standards, a
      property investment is recovered in ~10 years and a lending investment in ~20 years. Nobody set these standards,
      they were naturally set, through centuries, by people preferences and willingness to invest. Centralized lending
      (central reserve finance) has made some companies grow exponentially, specially banks, industrials, basic
      materials and technology. The latter sectors are heavily involved in the finance-capital supersector, that is
      largely hipertrophied.
    </p>
    <p>
      (This part might get a little technical)
    </p>
    <p>
      Second, a very subtle greed indicator. In times of greed investors want return, turning a blind eye on risk. This
      results in a market behaviour called inverted yield curve. In a normal yield curve, borrowing to long-term is more
      expensive yearly than borrowing to short-term and renovating the debt. This is 'normal', statistically default
      risk increases the longer the duration of the loan. However when stock market prices are overvalued, when a crisis
      is imminent, smart investors (usually high wealth investors) get out of the stock market. Where do they put the
      money?
      <p>

      </p>
      Before crises, smart money moves to government debt investment. In the context of a crisis, the central
      bank will lower interest rates to start reflating asset markets. Smart investors don't know how many years will
      the crisis and subsequent depression last, so they cautiously take long term bonds rather than short term ones.
      Short term bonds would have to be renovated soon at the lowered interest rates, earning less. But by buying long
      term bonds
      smart money gets to receive a fixed income return for many years. A temporary refuge from the markets. Besides the
      higher interest bonds rise in price so that the yield (interest rate/price) equals the one of new lower-interest
      bonds.
      So smart investors gain double: a safe stream of interest payments and bond price revaluation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The below pictures show inverted yield curve phenomenon. On the left graph, the yield curve is displayed. The
      x-axis is debt duration and on the y-axis the interest rate level. On the right graph you have the stock market
      price, on the x-axis you have date and on the y-axis you have the price level. On the right graph you can see the
      time at which the the yield curve was shot. For the last two crises (2000 and 2007) market tops were signaled by a
      flattened or inverted yield curve, as well as today (as of June 5th). I have also taken shots at other times
      during the uptrend so you can compare a normal yield curve with a flattened or inverted yield curve.

    <p>
      Before summarizing the monetary and market indicators of a crisis, I would like to comment on one more. To pay off
      debt, we need to increase production faster than what debt is growing. Production can be increased either by
      increasing productivity per person, or by increasing the number of persons. In the last 10 centuries banking
      worked
      well because both were happening at the same time. But in many occidental countries we have reached a demographic
      plateau, or even a depression. If you look at the <i data-toggle="tooltip"
        title="Demographic pyramids are a population distribution by 5-years age intervals">demographic pyramids</i>
      below, you will notice the world population is growing steadily. But growth is not equally distributed. Population
      has been shrinking in developed countries like US, Germany and Spain. In countries like India population is
      stabilizing or steadily growing. Middle East and North Africa countries are experiencing the greatest growth
      rates.

    <p>
      Demographic redistribution is not without consequences. Within developed countries population is aging. The people
      who retires soon will need their savings. However too many elder drawing out their life time savings will cause a
      <strong>major</strong> crisis, a calamity.
    </p>
    <p>
      To sum up ideas. Is the stock market crashing?
    </p>
    <p>
      In the monetary plan interest rates have been rising and the central bank has started selling its assets. Since
      December 2015 the bank interest rate has gone from ~0.2% to ~2.4%. Since January 2015 the US central bank has sold
      $640 million of assets, draining out of circulation an equal amount. Monetary deflation sooner or later causes
      money scarcity, prices deflation and tumbling profits. As soon as the market anticipates falling profits a crisis
      starts: assets start tumbling.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the market plan additional cash due to corporate tax rate reduction has boosted overconfidence and greed in the
      stock markets. Prices are twice the standard, so a downward correction is due. Falling profits can extend the
      tumble well below -50% giving place to a crisis. In addition, an inverted yield curve warns us investors are
      preferring longer-term bonds than shorter term, regardless of statiscal evidence of higher risk.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the demographic plan, in occidental countries, a great portion of the population is arriving at retirement age.
      These people will be soon withdrawing their lifetime savings. A fall in the stock market could affect them. Fear
      of realizing their loss might make them procrastinate selling their positions, but sooner or later they will have
      to. The crisis could extend through the 2020's, turning into a general depression. 
    </p>
<p>
  I invite you to take a look at this chart below. As of June 5th 2019 the Nasdaq 100 is at ~7200. My forecast is before 3 years from now the Nasdaq 100 will have reached ~3600. Odds are that the monetary-caused tumble will be more difficult to dissimulate than previous ones. Why?
