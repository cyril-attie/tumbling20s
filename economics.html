      Tumblien’s tale
    </h1>
    <p>
      Tumblien Tale is meant to observe the economy. The economy deals with how effort is organised to satisfy needs to
      sustain life. Economics could be applied to animals, but it's just too simple. Tumblien is an alien that tumbles
      on Earth and hacks the human economy. The story happens in a random time of History. Supposedly Tumblien takes a
      human shape unnoticeable.
    </p>
    <img src="" alt="Alien looking up in the middle of nature">
    <p>
      “Finally fresh air” thinks Tumblien breathing in. He goes out of the spaceship. After stretching he turns around,
      looks aside and
      notices birds singing. Few days forward Tumblien decided to build a shelter and live from cultivating the ground
      and hunting other animals. A primitive way to satisfy needs. Any person, in any time, would to do the same. Either
      self-employed or working for somebody who already settled down. Tumblien does on his own initiative.
    </p>

    <img src="" alt="Alien near sown crop fields and a wooden cottage ">
    <p>
      Tumblien is patient and persistent. Rapidly he is getting more vegetables then he needs to feed himself. “Even
      after saving enough food for 3 weeks, there is still more than half left. I do not want the remaining to rot". A
      passing peasant passed one day. Discussing, the peasant told Tumblien food was scarce and welcomed in towns. He
      feels happy to be able to help others. From now on once a week he journeys to one of the closest villages with his
      left over in hand.
    </p>

    <img src="" alt="Alien walking on the pathway with vegetables ">

    <h2>
      1. THE MARKET AND THE MAGIC MARKET
    </h2>

    <p>
      At the town Tumblien discover the myriad of products people bring. Some <strong>products available in great
        quantity cost little
        and rare products cost more</strong>, he wonders why. Asking Jack the trader, finds that “Some
      products are almost readily available in nature... while others cost more time and effort to get them made...”. He
      is told too about some <strong>magic products able to reduce the time needed to produce other products</strong>.
      “These magic products are similar to superpowers..." continues Jack "... as they'll allow you to do a day what
      before took you seven” adds Jack, looking more like a wizard than a trader. “Is there a magic product that could
      help me work the ground?” asks Tumblien full of enthousiasm. The magic trader disappears in the back store of the
      market stall. He
      comes back with an irrigation hose in his hands. Tumblien, reminding all the wet hours he spent going back and
      forth to the
      lake, happily agrees to trade the hose for all his surplus. He thanks Jack and thinks to himself “Ah, what a
      great deal”. He becomes now an entrepreneur that owns products made to produce faster.
    </p>

    <p>
      As the weeks pass Tumblien plants more land. With his new free time from the irrigation hose he can. He increases
      his
      production and free time. To the extent that he needs to go everyday to the market. Luckily he gets to trade his
      products
      for another great magic product: a carriage. With which he could transport at once what he used to take in 13
      trips to
      the village. “With this new carriage I won’t need to go to the village everyday anymore.” With time, he starts
      liking the town
      and trading. He admires the talents of people at creating magic. He is very grateful for the existence of the
      market.
      “If I would invent some magic product, I would probably take it to the market.” Tumblien thinks to himself
      “<strong>The market
        is
        the
        crosspoint of most trades, the union point of creativity and entrepreneurial initiative</strong>”. He likes to
      be among the firsts
      to discover newly appearing magic products. Consequently he intends to rent a market store. For that he hosts 2
      persons that agree to work with him. “I will teach you all you
      have to do. You can use my shelter. I will move to the village and trade our production to provide you with all
      you need”
      and the two workers noded yessing. Tumblien moved to a small building in the village. At the basefloor he holds
      vegetables shop.
    </p>

    <p>
      Everyday, early in the morning, he journeys to his shelter. And comes back to town before 7am with the carriage
      full. During the day he trades for other products. And the day after he carries back products to the persons who
      work at his shelter. Products for them, in exchange for their work, as well as magic products for the farm
      production. His farm keeps growing. In as little as 1 year the area cultivated has been extended tenfold and 14
      persons are working with him. Tumblien feels very lucky. He organizes the farm and the store. When others don’t
      know what he would do at their place they check with him and execute.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his store, on the shelter land, everywhere accumulated products are piling up. Products that were traded in for
      vegetables brought to
      the market. “We have 5 tablewares, meters of tissue to make clothes, clothes, some barrels of
      delicious drinks, wardrobes, decorated furnitures...” counts Tumblien. These products are <strong> wealth:
        valuable things,
        that cost time and work to be produced</strong>, and he already had them. He’s got to be a wealthy busy man, a
      businessman.
    </p>

    <img src="" alt="Store entry with fruits, things, other objects, shops in a commercial street of the village">
    <h2>
      2. ENTER THE SCENE MONEY
    </h2>

    <p>
      A night Tumblien was infatuated by a calm and passionate woman. Years forward they get married and bring some
      children. As his littles
      grow up, he is concerned: “As better magic products are produced, all products become producible with less time
      and effort… consequently<strong> all products are constantly becoming available in greater quantity </strong>. And
      the products
      I own are becoming available in greater quantity their price is falling...”. So he concludes his wealth is loosing
      value. “I don’t want my wealth to loose all its value. I would like to let something to the kids”. Accordingly
      he desires to trade his wealth. He asks for things that won't loose value through time. “How other wealthy
      business
      men store their wealth?” queries around in the market place. “The most wealthy men build big castles. Also
      they order pieces of art like portraits, gold jewelry and silver tableware. These pieces of art most often
      represent their will in life. An of their power to protect their interests.” Jack tells him. After careful
      analysis, “To store wealth, gold and silver have the
      best properties” judges Tumblien “durable without loosing any property, divisible to match any value size in trade
      and transportable without risk of damage. Not like castles or paintings”. Trading his wealth to avoid loosing
      value, Tumblien has become a wealth manager.
    </p>
    <IMG>
    <p>
      Soon he is only accepting silver and gold in exchange for his products. Also he starts trading out all his
      products, not only vegetables. <strong>The metals are his way to store the value of wealth</strong>. New improved
      magic products keep emerging. In consequence products availability in the market increases. But availability of
      gold and silver doesn't increase as fast. So the value of the metals doesn't fall as with the other products. “I
      will call <strong>'money' any product good to store value through time</strong>. They are money products”. The
      practice of trading against a unique good has some
      advantages. Everybody knows what to bring to Tumblien’s store to take food: metals. Rapidly the fashion
      spreads. All merchants follow storing wealth in metallic money. The vocabulary is accordingly expanded. "Trade” is
      replaced by two verbs: “buy” and “sell”. Buy means bringing money metals to the market expecting to take some
      other
      products. Sell means bringing some products to the market expecting to receive money products for them. "Pay"
      means giving money products, giving metals. "Liquidity" means how easily a product can be sold, in other words,
      transformed into money. Metals are by excellence the most liquid product as they are used as money. Everybody in
      the horizon is now using metals as money products. Because of storing value, a unpredented use is found for
      metals: transmutability (of changeableness). Metals become a wild card product transmutable, changeable, against
      any other with great acceptance. Also it that can be stored up for future use. Storing it means changing present
      products against future products.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recall: Tumblien Tale is meant to observe the economy. The economy deals with how effort is organised to satisfy
      needs to sustain life.
    </p>
    <h2>
      3. INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION TRIGGER
    </h2>
    <p>
      Tumblien expresses his thought as such "metals are the most liquid product. They can be turned into anything that
      has
      been produced by humans. Money is the way to stay wealthy. As more people uses metals as money, the same
      quantity will be split among more people. Therefore, <strong>the more people uses metals as
        money the more valuable becomes money</strong> due to scarcity of metals. Furthermore as products become
      available in greater quantity they will cost less money. Therefore <strong>the more
        abundant are products, the more valuable becomes money</strong> due to abundance of products”. Tumblien knows
      metallic money will grow a very valuable product. Forward in time security must turn into a concern.
    </p>
    <p>
      “How other wealthy men safe guard their money?” wonders Tumblien. “Since money is such a valuable product, I
      could start up a safe deposit of money. I will call it bank.” The new bank is not very welcome in the market.
      Obviously, people is mistrustful about leaving their wealth at another's place. However Tumblien gets a brilliant
      idea to make it run. “To make the fashion spread I need prestige." Tumblien finds out "No one is more prestigious
      than the merchants that bring everything to the town. So I will start by these small elite." Tumblien realizes his
      purpose "To make the wealthiest merchants use the bank receipts as money instead of metals”. Through secret
      meetings Tumblien communicated his intentions. He proposed good credit conditions, low interests, easy money to
      wealthy businessmen. He eloquently showed that the bank receipts would allow them to buy more magic products and
      expand their power. In exchange, these prestigious celebrities would store their wealth at the bank and use bank
      receipts instead, so that the public follows. They took the hook.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, as wealthy merchants used bank receipts to pay their employees, people attended the bank to cash the
      receipt. After some weeks, they spared the trip to the bank and just use the receipt as money. All happened as if
      people voluntarily had deposited their metals in the bank. Two moneys coexisted for long, metals money (a product)
      and receipt money (a paper). The receipts took a prestigious name "Bills". And as bills were a standard quantity,
      account checkbooks were used too. On an acount check one could write any metal quantity to be transferred, not
      only the standard 1oz. (ounce is 28.3495 grams) bill. People started indifferently confusing bills and metals
      moneys, and calling them just money. Tumblien, along with his family and secret prestigious network, have gotten
      to be known in the marketplace as the Banker, the banking family and their collaborators.
    </p>
    <IMG>
    <p>
      People rarely come to ask their metals money. Instead they get used to the lightness of bills. The real money
      (metals) stays in the safe-deposit box. Years forward, the level of real money in the safe didn’t
      fell once under 80% of the peak quantity. And actually only rises year over year. Everybody is now holding
      deposits at the bank, as if the greatest debtor of all was Tumblien's bank. “I can now proceed to lend this idle
      money as agreed with the wealthy businessmen that collaborated" reasons the human-like alien. The banking project
      gets hackier than ever here. Tumblien decides to <strong>lend not the actual metal money but rather issues new
        bills on interest</strong>. And that is how Tumblien hacked money and the economy. A hack in his favor, a scam,
      a dishonest scheme for most.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every scam has two sides: an appealing side made public and a conspiratory side kept secret.

      On the one hand lending money made people around him richer. First he lent his network of wealthy businessmen. In
      exchange for the issued bills he receives a written commitment to pay back the money and some interests, a credit
      contract. Around him wealthy business men blossom.
      With the credit bills they buy state-of-the-art magic goods. Magic products reduce the costs of time and work
      under competitors' costs. And they get to raise more revenue by selling at the cheapest price.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reflecting on the magic products, “Businessmen succeed thanks to the magic products. With the latest magic
      products, producing costs less time and effort. We've got to increase the quantity of products available, lower
      their price below competitors'. Magic products are
      really important. I will call them <strong>capital products, meaning they lead the quantity and price of
        products</strong>”.
    </p>
    <p>
      Around Tumblien, the quantity of products increases dramatically. The phenomenon is called <strong>industrial
        revolution</strong>. People gets to live longer in the town. They work in some bank-financed business. Wages,
      which is the money paid to employees of these companies, are the same as elsewhere. However, as products are
      cheaper, people get to live at ease. Employees can sustain their life, their family's life and even save money. A
      <strong>rural exodus</strong> takes place. People moves from the country to the city. Abundance of hygiene
      products allows children to stop dying in their infancy. The result is the <strong>demographic
        transition</strong>: the population doubles every few decades. Remember: the more people use money, the scarcer
      money is. Therefore the value of money steadily increases. Credit to businessmen pours into circulation new bills
      to balance scarcity. Tumblien's network triumphs: entrepreneurs bring additional metal money every year to the
      bank. The Banker decides to scale. He orders opening banks in every town where magic products are traded. “The
      network is burgeoning. We bring the lowest-effort production techniques everywhere. We finance the most
      state-of-the-art businesses. We lead the lowest prices. We constantly monitor the market for new capital products.
      We provide people with the cheap material products that all like and need; at a low-cost with a profitable margin"
      Tumblien tells to Jack, as if the pupil overwhelmed the master. But Jack is a magician too and starts unraveling
      Tumbliens trick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack spotlights the conspiratory side of the Bank. First the bank lends at an interest. Depositors are lending to
      the bank, but customers receive no interest. Second for every bill put into circulation, the bank records a debt
      balance. The bill put into circulation does not increase. A bill stays a bill. But the debt balance increases
      exponentially. Every year 5% is added to the due debt balance.<strong> After some years, debtors that pay off
        their debt balance retrieve more money from circulation than what was poured in</strong>. So circulating money
      diminishes for every loan. To keep the circulating money afloat, new debt has to be made. New debt is made to
      compensate for the bills returned to the bank<strong>The new debt must always be greater than the
        previous</strong>. The new debt must be greater or equal to what was returned to the bank. <strong>After some
        decades, the debt balance overcomes the circulating money. And some decades later the debt balance overcomes the
        existing money. After some centuries, the yearly interests overcomes the whole production. In other words,
        working all the year is not enough to pay the interests on the debt</strong> In other words, the banking system
      is a scam. People benefits much from it as it unites them around state-of-the-art capital companies. Theses
      companies are successful at increasing production per person. Allowing all people to benefit from more products.
      But it is a <strong>dangerous assymetric synergy: an unfair system</strong>. Privileges to access to unlimited
      resources are reserved to a Banker's network. Resources they use to provide people with all they need at a cheap
      price. A great advantage, unless the underneath poison is noticed. The banking system chains people. The due debt
      balance is growing exponentially and never can never be paid off with a constant amount of money. <strong>"While
        on the short term it hepls provide people with all they need, the banking credit system is designed to enslave
        people on the long term." </strong> concludes Jack the wizard. But Jack decides not to say a word. He just wants
      to observe.
    </p>

    <h2>
      4. FINANCE TAKEOVER
    </h2>
    <p>
      Other businessmen decide to copy Tumblien. Banks multiply. Some bankers act imprudently issuing too many bills.
      They risk a <strong>bank run: not having real money anymore when enough depositors redeem their bill at
        once</strong>. Bank runs are a problem not only for the concerned bank, but for all banks. WHen they see a bank
      failing the public looses trust in all banks. To remove weak points Tumblien come with another great idea: “It is
      in the interest of all banks to join forces. All banks depends on the reputation of others. We can create a bank
      of
      banks. Call it central bank. All the real money of banks will be stored there. Other banks will then store mainly
      bills of the
      central bank. And people will use either central bank bills or bank accounts checkbooks equivalent to central bank
      bills. The risk of banks would be pooled. A bank run could only happen to the central bank. And it is easier to
      protect one bank than all of them." He goes ahead with the project. Meets secretly other banker and his idea
      succeeds among them. <strong>The central bank holds all the real money previously stored in banks. And banks only
        hold deposits of central bank bills.</strong> To satisfy their needs, people trades with central bank bills or
      account checkbooks that allow to tranfer stored bills from one account to another.
    </p>

    <p>
      <!-- 
        At this stage Tumblien upgrades to mind shaper: he is wealthy, mighty among the most successful business men and
        wants to lock in his position ,
        
        credit:new bill-money issued without real-money deposited,
 -->

      “Most credit is granted to buy capital products" observes Tubmlien. "Consequently credit increases prices of
      capital product companies first. Then, as the new money filters to the employees of these companies, prices of all
      goods follow in the rise." Reasons Tumblien. Indeed, because employees spend in a variety of products, all product
      prices increase then. "So on the one hand" he remarks "the larger the increase in prices of products, the more
      people notices the bill is loosing value. On the other hand" continuing "better magic products make products
      available in greater quantity so product prices will fall progressively". Tumblien notices the price increase is
      faster than the increased quantity of products, and the subsequent fall in prices. He wonders “How to prevent
      people from noticing the value of the bill is devaluating? People could convert their bills back into real money
      if they notice” He sends an order to banks to rise the interest on loans. Effectively business men take less loans
      at the higher interest. The effect is that capital companies see their revenue tumble. Since nobody is taking
      loans businessmen coming to buy become rare. Eventually, these capital companies fail to raise enough revenue to
      pay employees. So they either lower the salary of employees or fire everyone and shut down operations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Raising terest rates works: as businessmen pay off their debt, bills drained from ciculation pile up in bank.
      Prices fall twice: the greater availability of products and the scarcity of circulating bills. "Raising interest
      rates hit two targets with one shot: provide the opportunity to acquire very cheap magic products and revert the
      bill devaluation so nobody notices what is really happening." Business become even more profitable acquiring
      cheap capital products. However, in times in which product prices fall, no entrepreneur wants to take a loan.
      Entrepreneurs wait until prices bottom.

    <p>

      Very sophisticated way to satisfy needs. Create a digital accounting system.
      Replace metal money trade with paper bills trade. Alternate periods of
      abundance and scarcity of these bills. Periods of product scarcity and rising
      prices. With periods of product surplus and falling prices. In other words inflate or deflate the circulating
      quantity of money. Distract people. “I can arm business men with the best capital products. I can influence prices
      through inflation and deflation. Besides, deflations are greater than previous inflations. Deflations contain
      additional
      interests that were not introduced during the previous inflation. As a result, to maintain the quantity of
      circulating money
      stable, subsequent inflations must be greater than previous deflations”.

      His network is very connected and committed. Everybody serves to the purpose of mantaining the system. They
      finance academics and mass media that plead his system. They gain popularity in
      any new country by financing prestigious people, like kings and emperors. They know how to manage these powerful
      customers. The latter, due to their position, tend to believe they are free to skip paying off. However Tumbliens'
      network doesn't hesitate at secretly financing their ideological enemies. They promote ideological division,
      discredit the current authority and
      make a revolution. Sometimes split ideas evolve in a civil war. Tumblien is able to decide which side wins by
      financing them. But he doesn't abuse his power. He let the war finish and approaches his winner-prey after the
      war, when he is weakest.
      He approaches it to finance reconstruction and to install a central bank system. He provides the most industrial
      production methods known by his network. His network that is spreading worldwide.
    </p>
    <p>
      They promote the idea of nations. Nations like territories delimited by borders. The smaller the nation the easier
      to manipulate. They back the ideas of democratic governments. They legitimize democracy associating it with noble
      ideals nobody can deny like freedom and human rights protection. Inthe shallow indeed governments work toward
      these goals. But in-depth governments are a way to lend securely. “Lending to a government is perfect. It is as
      good as lending to all people compulsorily and make them pay back through taxes. This way we pool the risk of
      bankruptcy on all taxable people, even the rich. We get to impoverish every one together. But us” brags Tumblien.
      They lobby policies to lock the bill system. Make taxes payable only with bill money. Confiscate real,
      value-saving and metallic, money. Fine those who use real money. And, obviously, stop the convertibility of the
      bill money into real money. They are really influencing.

      During the elections, by financing one party or another, they decide the most advertised party. As people is
      distracted with sensorial stimulus, the most advertised party is the one elected. They promote a convoluted
      regulation. A regulation we all ought to know but barely some read and no one wants to read. This regulation will allow them to pay the
      minimum taxes and earn the most profits. Basically Tumblien employs think tanks to think how to optimize and
      protect the system he had created.

    <h2>5.OVER-EXPANSION AND BACK TO NATURE.</h2>

    <p>
      The system Tumblien created is rooting up. His network is constantly monitoring new innovations and are the
      firsts
      to
      invest in new techniques. As the technique spread to other companies the the profits dilute. Consequently
      entrepreneurs are continuously renovating themselves with the latest capital products. System agents are sent to
      other lands looking for new creative magic. These agents are also used to inform Tumblien on the possibility of
      Banking there, the kind of government there is, if any, and the prestigious institutions that lead people’s
      beliefs.
      “To keep the system growing we need to keep increasing the quantity of people that uses the central Bank bills
      and
      the quantity of products in the market place available to trade against bank bills.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Decades forward Tumblien and his network spreads to many other territories and peoples. Their degree of control
      is
      different in every place. In order to be liked by the different peoples they create different names for the bills
      in
      each nation. But the network is the same and they’re all connected and collaborating towards the same purpose:
      control the magic. Even though they grow rapidly they do not reach to completely install their system in every
      nation. In many nations the local power is hostile to Tumblien network. In others they accept it for production
      purposes but set up a similar banking system. And some surrender completely and collaborate with Tumblien system
      provided they can have loans. Loans that sometimes get stolen by the men in government before the taxed people
      receives any benefit. The Earth gets filled of people speaking about money and the benefits of capital products.
      Though not many get to understand them the way Tumblien does, peoples race to acquire or develop the latest
      capital
      products. Often wars happen between local peoples that do not want to surrender to Tumblien’s network and the now
      global network. Initially Tumblien didn’t want to make wars. He just wanted to secure a living for his children.
      But
      people in his network are trained to implement the safest strategy to the greatest profits that implies
      supervising
      others’ growth. Thanks to their production techniques and followers, Tumblien network is well prepared to win the
      wars and wins. The defeated nations agree to follow Tumblien network’s rules “for the peace of the world”.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, a key reversal for Tumblien’s network is the birth of computers and the Internet. Internet has brought
      new
      ways to communicate that challenge Tumblien network in 2 main ways. On the one hand the Internet allows anyone to
      create content and publish it to the world. One of the strengths of Tumblien network is being able to control the
      advertising medias and the influencing scholars that make public education subejct. But Tumblien’s network needs
      to
      be able to address directly the influencers of a people to get their favors. Now with the arrival of Internet the
      content creation is distributed among too many influencers to orchestrate them all. Furthermore the prestige and
      popularity of influencers is much more ephemere and dynamic than in the old academic and medias institutions so
      it’s
      more difficult to choose influencers partners. The techniques and ideas travel instantly all around the world and
      the
      system of agents deployed to collect information is not anymore an advantage. On the other hand the computational
      power of computers allows to create public cryptography accounting systems, called blokchains. These systems are
      very
      similar to Tumblien’s system in that they create an accounting book of units. Blockchains differ from Tumblien
      system
      in that they do not need an intermediary (a Tumblien), the real money backing the virtual “bill” money units can
      be
      any product (not only gold and silver) and anybody is able to replicate the system as the code is open source.
      Basically anyone can now create his own central bank accounting book and digitals “bills”.
    </p>
    <p>
      The actual story of Tumblien is goes viral through the Internet. As people becomes aware of how they were fooled
      they
      steadily want to start using metals and blockchain tokens as money away from governments and central banks money.
      But
      not all people is convinced and many still believe Tumblien’s network. Many profit from it. Many provide their
      children with food thanks to the system. These are afraid of giving up the comfort of the familiar day-to-day for
      anything else. Many have strong beliefs and little time that can barely reflect clearly without being demanded or
      distracted by their lives. However some people got to know the true Tumblien.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tumblien misused popularity and prestige to embezzle real money. Doing wrong and felt the need to protect himself
      from innocent people. He disposed of the latest capital products without bringing anything to the market. For
      decades
      he mislead peoples into confusion bribing academics and politicians and buying communication medias that united
      to
      his network. He made leaders forgo their fundamental principles in order to speed their individual success helped
      by
      his network. He influenced institutions leaders in order to join the network of face the consequences. By wanting
      to
      impose his system he has generated discord among peoples who lived well before. Civil wars have sprung between
      his
      global network followers and local people who denied any need to install such a catchy system. The young people
      who
      discover his story, then travel and and look for a free land where to settle and live far from his dominating
      system.
      The ones engaged into a life project hardly can imagine how to adapt, so fear the change. The older seem
      indifferent
      and think they just won’t see the system fall.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his room of ideas Tumblien is now in the dilemma of whether he really wants to keep growing his system. He is
      concerned that by growing his system he disturbs innocent livings. But there’s a whole network of millions of
      people
      on guard expecting him to keep illuminating the path to further power and control. To further order. At the top
      of
      the pyramid he oversees all operations, being informed to take decisions. He is constantly presented with the
      prospect of creating more terrorism and wars. For his network, peoples are more receptive when they are afraid,
      angry
      or weak so they promote wars. And that is the story of how Tumblien, the alien hacked the economy, that is, the
      way
      people satisfy their needs.
