            <h2>What is a Crisis?</h2>
            <p>Ten years ago, when I was 14 years old, the Great Recession stroke the economy. For 5 years I heard
                everywhere that crisis had happened and the economy was doing poorly. I watched in the news people
                demonstrating in the streets of New York and Madrid, long queues at every Greek ATM and stock
                market traders pulling their hair away. During my first year in college studying physics I decided
                to give me a chance understand what really happened. So I droped and started my journey to
                understand <a href="crisis.html">what's a crisis</a>.
                It's been now 6 years since I read my first economic book. I have passed through private banking
                departments, trading and dealing rooms and brokerage firms. I have investigated monetary economics
                and wrote my thesis on the impact of bitcoin in the monetary system. I am soon opening my company a
                wealth management.
