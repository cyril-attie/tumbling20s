    <h2>Hello, Crisis!</h2>
    <span>
      <p>
        The crystal clear criteria of a Crisis happening is that prices of <i data-toggle="tooltip"
          title="A tangible asset is a real estate or production good. An intangible asset is a share of the property or the debt often linked to a set of tangible assets like a company.">assets</i>
        fall sharply, behind 50% of their peak price in less than 3 years.
      </p>
      <p>
        A crisis, it has been asserted, is a bad or wrong time for the economy. Not for those who know what a crisis
        really
        is. To test whether a crisis is bad, we would need to define an economic purpose. So that any action nearing us
        to our purpose is defined as good, and the rest is bad. But in life rarely do we have common purposes. So let's
        see for who a crisis is good and for who it is bad.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ones that have savings invested in some asset become frightened of having lost 50% of their
        savings.
        And that happens to all those who were not informed and did not know to foresee the coming crisis. For most of
        the people it becomes a
        bad time.
        Clients, having lost wealth, consume less so businesses struggle to earn <i data-toggle="tooltip"
          title="Revenue is the income of companies.">revenue</i>.
        Shopping sales slow down, store inventories pile up. Eventually companies lower prices in search for revenue.
        As productions calms down materials
        and commodities generally become cheaper. But wages often cannot be lowered (at least
        below the minimum legal threshold). Consequently companies fire employees because they fail at earning
        enough
        money to pay <i data-toggle="tooltip"
          title="Liabilities are all the debts or pending payments, as for example wages, that a company owes.">liabilities</i>.
        The blossoming unemployed people difficults even more the rush for revenue. The falling revenues sweep a
        great portion of <i data-toggle="tooltip"
          title="Profit is the income of owners of companies. It is the result of subtracting costs to revenues.">profits</i>.
        In the stock market, a fair price for a company is 10 times the profits of the company.
        With a disappearing profits stock prices fall even more. They fall below 50% their peak price.
      </p>
      <p>
        But there's a right side to everything. People that can dispose of money during the crisis find cheap prices.
        This group can
        be divided in two major categories: </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Those that have savings</li>
        <li>Those that can take a credit</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The cheaper the price of an investment the lower the risk. To catch the crisis cheap price one needs money.
        Having money means being prepared. Being prepared one gets to invest at a lower risk.
        On the other side of the market panic is taking over. People that invested at a high price take losses. Taking
        losses makes
        one become wary and mistrustful. Frustration and anxiety to see prices come back to their peak spreads. People
        that becomes unemployed also thinks negatively. Crisis induced negativity is an economic depression. An economic
        depression happens after prices have fallen. Entrepreneurs are negative about starting a new business. And I want to change this reaction. If you do not have an economic background this website is made for you. Here you will get a glance on <a href="economics.html">why and how crises happen. </a> As well we will look into<a href="forecasting.html">how the Tumbling 20’s</a>, the great depression of the 2020's, shall happen.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you do not have an economic background I recommend reading Tumblien’s tale before continuing. If you are
        familiar with the meaning of economic concepts such as capital, money, banks. If you can distinguish monetary and price inflation. In short,if you are an economic and financial markets geek. Then proceed reading on this page to understand the implications of crises. I've made it worth your time.

<!-- 
UP TILL HERE IT IS CHECKED, SATISFACTORY 
-->

      <p>
        During periods of <i data-toggle="tooltip"
          title=" Inflation happens when the quantity of money is increasing, generally due to credit granting.">inflation</i>,
        business men take credits to buy capital products. As prices move up speculators also take credit in order to
        buy products cheap and re-sell them at a higher price. So we know the quantity of circulating money inflates
        due to credit. As the greater availability of money is felt, its value falls. Simply stated, it becomes easier
        to find somebody that gives you money for any work because there is more money. But the inflation isn’t felt
        simultaneously by all people. As the credits are often granted to buy capital products, the firsts to feel
        inflation are generally the traders of capital products. Their revenue abnormally increases as new clients,
        that wouldn’t buy without the existence of credit, come to buy capital products.
      </p>
      <p>As capital product companies increase their revenue, they employ more people and raise the salary of already
        existing employees. Unlike business men who have taken a credit, employees tend to spend their money in a great
        variety of products. So at this stage companies producing any product gets to increase their sales and
        eventually to rise the price of their products. Consequently almost all companies see their revenues and
        profits increase. Unemployment falls as companies employ more people to expand their production and wages grow
        as money abounds in the hands of all.
      </p>
      <p>As prices increase, the same quantity of money is able to purchase less goods. In order to avoid a too
        noticeable decrease in the value of money banks rise interest rates. Profits are revenues minus costs. Rising
        interest rates increases financial costs, so shrinks profits. As projects become less profitable, entrepreneurs
        and and speculators give back their credits to the banks. As money flows back to the banks and piles up there,
        the circulating money becomes scarcer. The monetary deflation causes price deflation. In this phase it becomes
        harder to find buyers, people willing to pay for products or assets, at the current high prices. So all prices,
        wages, products and assets, tend to revert their trend and to start falling.
      </p>
      <p>It is likely that a crisis is happening at this stage. <strong>Prices crash</strong> so the crisis becomes an
        opportunity. It is an economic opportunity because people, specially entrepreneurs and speculators, are
        desperate trying to sell their assets in order to give back their debt. So they sell them cheaper than else
        when because of the urgency. Not any entrepreneur dares to take a credit in times of deflation because they do
        not believe in succeeding. Basically if nobody would take a credit again the money would disappear and the
        trading would collapse and restart on another basis. But the government does not worry about giving back its
        credits, it is the only entity that can relaunch the economy by taking a big credit and pouring this new money
        into the circulation so that prices turn up again and businessmen see hope. So usually crises become the
        opportunity for governments to make the expensive projects it has not done before like roads, social measures
        or wars, to quote some examples. As soon as the government and the medias speak about spending or something
        related to spending, like “rescuing the economy”, the entrepreneur public start believing the prices will
        eventually turn up again and then take credit to acquire capital at a cheap price. </p>
      <p>
        There is a detail, that is rarely understood, that I deem the most important fact of the monetary cycle loop.
        In order to be able to give back the debt, entrepreneurs and the government need rising prices. In a falling
        prices environment it is increasingly difficult to raise money and so to give back the debt, so the
        entrepreneurs tend to give back their debt. In order to keep the prices stable and steadily increasing, the
        subsequent credits must be always bigger than previous ones. In conclusion, the quantity of money is always
        increasing.
        Let me introduce a brief example to show how the quantity of money must be always increasing in order to be
        able to give back the debts.
        Let’s imagine a society in which there is 100 ounces of gold existing used as money, some circulating and some
        stored. Imagine that on the first day of year 1 everybody puts his money in the bank in exchange for a bill. So
        at the beginning of the first year there are
        100 bills existing and circulating and the bank stores 100 ounces of gold that back the bills.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the first 5 years the bank issues 4 additional bills every year to grant credit to entrepreneurs and
        speculators at 2.5% interest rate per year, a fairly low interest rate that results in inflation. For the
        curious, interest cost is calculated as a percentage of the previous end-of-year debt balance. After 5 years
        the quantity of bills circulating has risen to 120 (initial 100 plus 4 per year during 5 years). The debt
        balance at the end of the fifth year is 21.55 bills (20 issued as credit plus 1.55 of accumulated interest
        costs of the 5 years). At this stage prices have been rising: the monetary inflation has caused price
        inflation.
      </p>
      <p>
        To dissimulate monetary and price inflation banks rise the interest rates to 6% expecting that the public will
        take less credit. They keep the interest rates at this high level for 5 years. This causes monetary deflation:
        entrepreneurs return bills to the banks instead of taking newly issued bills, so the circulating bills decrease
        instead of increasing. In other words, every year 4 bills are subtracted from the circulating bills and put
        into the banks.
      </p>
      <p>
        After 5 years returning money to the banks, the quantity of money has fallen back to 100 bills. But now prices
        are lower than at the beginning, do you guess why? As credits taken by entrepreneur in the first 5 years were
        used to buy capital products, these productive investments are giving results. Capital products have the
        ability to increase productivity which is the quantity of products we can produce in a specified period of
        time. So the capital products bought 5 years ago result in lower product prices because of increased
        availability of products. In order to compensate for the lower prices, if we want to have rising prices, the
        money to be poured into circulation through credit must be more than the previous credit, we will suppose the
        yearly credit granted
        increases by 4 every inflation period. Also, we will suppose the yearly credit returned to the banks increases
        by 2 every deflation period. The following table illustrates the evolution of the monetary and financial state,
        the money and debt quantities, every year for the first 50 years and every 25 years for the next 250 years.

        During the second inflation period (from year 10 to year 15) the credit granted every year is 8 bills instead
        of 4 bills. The table shows how after 40 years running such a banking system the bills existing in total are
        210, of which 160 are circulating and 50 are in the banks. The total debt owed to the banks has become 181
        bills. Basically there is not anymore enough bills circulating to pay back the debt owed to the banks.
        Consequently this debt can never be paid after 40 years, peoples using this money are trapped because any
        increase in the circulating bills is done through increasing the debt too. Due to interest rates the debt
        exponentially increases through time so the only chance for people to be able to pay the debt would be to
        devalue completely the bills used as money. But it is non-sense to devalue money because it is what people uses
        to store the value of their wealth.</p>
      <p>
        Assuming you understood the previous example are several conclusions to be made about how economics are useful.
        First, things are cheaper in the present than in the future so if you are going to make any investment it is
        better to make it now than later. Second you should get as much debt as you can and spend it now in productive
        assets. Since credit is equivalent to borrow money from the future in order to restore it later and goods are
        cheaper today than in the future it is easy to conclude that the more debt the better. This is easy to
        understand by asking any elder what was the price of houses when he was young, the answer will probably be
        about a seventh what they are today. In other words, if he wanted to buy a house today it would cost him 7
        times what he would have paid if he had taken a credit long ago and paid the cheap prices of the past. And the
        quantity of money always increases exponentially, every credit is bigger than the previous. Third, do not take
        credit on bad conditions, high interest rates make the debt balance skyrocket fast. Debts with no interest or
        very low interest (less than 2.5%) are good debts that will allow you to succeed making a business. And
        actually that is what corporations do, as soon as the estimated profit of a project is higher than their
        average cost of capital (the interest rate they pay to borrow in order to buy capital goods), they will
        undertake the project. And eventually they'll close it if it is not succesful.

        For the last 300 years when a price deflation happened, entrepreneurs struggled to raise enough money to pay
        their debts. The only chance for countries to make prices rise again was to make the government take a big
        credit. A credit big enough to take out the money that had been returned to the banks during the monetary
        deflation
        and issue new bills so prices start increasing again. Besides government politicians like to spend for 2
        reasons. Firstly they become more liked by the people who benefit from the government spending. Secondly
        because they get liked by bankers: the same bankers that financed their campaign will also finance the
        government spending and profit from it. Lending to the government is the safest way to lend money as the
        government does not need to sell anything to customers to raise money, they can tax people directly by law. The
        same law bankers’ families have been lobbying for centuries in order to favor them. The fact that the
        government relay entrepreneurs for taking credit in times of deflation is very bad for two main reasons: first
        the government provides services at a cheaper cost than entrepreneurs so it is very hard for entrepreneur to
        prosper when the government already provides with what the entrepreneur wants to produce. Second the common
        debt is unpayable unless we tax people more severely, but nobody wants to be taxed. So basically the government
        incurs in additional spending to watch and check people pays their taxes because they need to give back the
        debt nobody wants to pay. This turn into authoritarism, which is when a government does whatever he wants
        claiming he is doing it for the security and wellbeing of the people.
      </p>

        To conclude, crisis are often thought of as an accident but many people benefit from it and some intentionally
        provoke it. After periods of monetary inflation, product prices hook and price inflation takes up. In parallel
        production is steadily increasing thanks to capital investment. Banks restrain price inflation by rising
        interest rates so that people does not notice monetary inflation. At a higher interest rates entrepreneurs
        return their credit. Money returns to the banks and piles up there as no
        entrepreneur wants to take a credit in times of price deflation. Price deflation doubles due to the
        production increase brought by new capital and monetary deflation. Assets sharply fall in price and employees
        are fired massively in order to liquidate unprofitable projects. At this stage bankers dispose of abundant
        money and can purchase
        capital products at the cheapest price. As soon as banks and banks’ entrepreneurs network purchase capital
        products on credit again, the economy is relaunched by another monetary inflation. Usually, the government
        intervenes taking a big credit to prevent prices from falling, which is the flag for entrepreneurs that new
        monetary inflation is coming soon.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a healthy vs a precipitated choice to be made. In every crisis the precipitated choice is to relaunch
        the economy with a government credit. Generally that maintains the system, the artificially swollen capital
        products industry and the high product prices. We might thank the fast development of Internet to the fact that
        much credit is used to fund capital products like machines and computers. On the contrary the healthy choice is
        to halt the bill-money system and to go back to some more open and explicit way to trade products; either by
        using product money like gold and silver or by using blockchain crypto-currencies or product tokens or a
        combination
        of both. Blockchains must still experiment scalability and security maturation but they’re proving to be the
        most legitimate way to organize people without a central weak point of authority like the bribable politicians
        of the government.
